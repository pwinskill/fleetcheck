# The IBM does not depend on fleet, so its committed rows stay valid for any
# fleet-side change and there is no reason to re-run a 25-minute IBM sweep to
# find out whether the match still holds. This re-runs fleet only, against the
# frozen reference.
#
# Two questions, reported separately because they mean different things:
#
#   1. Did anything MOVE?  fleet now against fleet's committed rows. A moved
#      number is not automatically wrong -- a deliberate model fix moves numbers
#      -- but it must be SEEN. Silent movement is how a regression ships.
#   2. Is the match still GOOD?  fleet now against the committed IBM medians and
#      10-90% bands, at the thresholds the article's claims rest on. This is the
#      gate, and the only thing that fails the run by default.
#
# Exit 0 = still matching. Exit 1 = drift beyond threshold (or, under
# CMP_STRICT, any movement at all).

## `rel` is the largest tolerated |fleet / IBM median - 1| over the EIR grid, set
## from what the models achieve today with room to spare (currently 1.6%, 2.6%,
## 2.1% and 6.2% against the limits below).
##
## `out` is how many grid points may fall OUTSIDE the IBM's 10-90% replicate
## range -- a count of failures, not of successes, so CMP_ONLY can check a subset
## without the limit becoming unreachable. These are set AT today's values, with
## no slack: 0, 1, 1 and 2 of 6. That is deliberate rather than an oversight.
## fleet is deterministic and the IBM reference is frozen, so nothing here
## fluctuates; a point moving in or out of the band is a real change every time,
## and there is no noise for headroom to absorb. Loosen one only when you have
## decided the new value is correct, and say so in the commit.
##
## Severe is loosest on both because it is the rarest outcome and the noisiest in
## the IBM: see the article's Programmes section for the widths.
