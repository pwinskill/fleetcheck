# House style for the fleet-vs-malariasimulation comparison figures.
#
# Sourced by run_replicates.R (live) and render_figures.R (re-render from saved
# CSVs), so the two never drift. Everything visual lives here: palette, theme,
# series scales, and the small helpers every figure shares.
#
# Design rules (see the dataviz method the figures were built against):
#   * Two series, IBM vs fleet, encoded THREE ways -- colour, line type, point
#     shape -- so every panel reads in greyscale and under colour-vision
#     deficiency. Palette validated: indigo/coral pass CVD dE 27 (protan) and
#     normal-vision dE 38; both >= 3:1 on white.
#   * The IBM is stochastic. It is drawn as the median of N replicates with a
#     10-90% envelope at ~15% opacity, never as one noisy realisation.
#   * LAYER ORDER: where the two series overlap -- which, when the models agree,
#     is everywhere -- the mark that hides less goes on top. So the IBM's dashed
#     median draws OVER fleet's solid line (the solid shows through the gaps, so
#     both read), while fleet's hollow point draws OVER the IBM's filled one.
#     The envelope always sits at the bottom. Get this backwards and agreement
#     looks like a single series.
#   * Thin marks, hairline SOLID gridlines one step off the surface, no panel
#     border, legend at the top, titles left-aligned. Text never wears a series
#     colour.
#   * One y-axis per panel. Two measures = two panels (patchwork), never a dual axis.
