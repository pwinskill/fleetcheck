# Constants shared by every comparison script: paths, and the scenario settings
# that must be identical across them.
#
# Split out of theme.R so the scripts that do not draw anything -- the 25-minute
# IBM run and the drift check -- do not have to load ggplot2, patchwork, ragg and
# systemfonts just to read POP and EIR_GRID. That keeps the drift check's CI
# dependency list to fleet, malariasimulation, digest and jsonlite, which is both
# faster and one less thing to break when a plotting package changes.
#
# theme.R sources this, so anything that draws still gets these too.

## ---- paths ------------------------------------------------------------------
## Every comparison script sets ROOT (the checkout root) before sourcing this
## file, so nothing here is machine-specific either. VDIR points at the optional
## site-file validation results, which live in their own checkout beside this
## one; override with FLEET_VALIDATE. The site figure and its table are skipped
## when it is absent.
